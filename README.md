I want a simple blog api, with the purpose of getting a handle on Golang.

The content will be centered around a users postand fill the needs reqired.

Each blog post will have a title, body, author, created_at and a privacy_type (public, friends, private)

Each user will have a username, *firstname, *lastname, email and created_at.

Future updates could including scaling to genres.
